  <h1>CSS Syntax and Selectors</h1> 
  <h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
  A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block: <br> <br>
  <img src="selector.gif" alt=""> <br> <br>
  The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.<br> <br>
  The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.<br> <br>

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.<br> <br>

A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.<br> <br>

In the following example all <b>p</b> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color <br> <br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<xmp>
    p {
        color: red;
        text-align: center;
    }
</xmp>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p style="color: red; text-align: center;">
This is a parragraph with center text-aling and red color</p>
<h1>CSS Selectors</h1> 
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute, and more.
<h1>The element Selector</h1>
The element selector selects elements based on the element name. <br><br>
You can select all <b>p</b> elements on a page like this (in this case, all <b>p</b> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color):
<h3>Example</h3>
<xmp>
    p {
        color: red;
        text-align: center;
    }
</xmp>
<h1>The id Selector</h1>
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. <br><br>
The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element! <br><br>
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element. <br><br>
The style rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1":
<h3>Example</h3>
<xmp>
    #para1 {
        color: red;
        text-align: center;
        }
</xmp>
<b>Note:</b> An id name cannot start with a number!
<h1>The class Selector</h1>
The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.<br><br>

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.<br><br>

In the example below, all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned:
<h3>Example</h3>
<xmp>
    .center {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }
</xmp>
You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. <br><br>
In the example below, only <b>p</b> elements with class="center" will be center-aligned:
    <h3>Example</h3>
<xmp>
    p.center {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }
</xmp>
HTML elements can also refer to more than one class. <br><br>
In the example below, the <b>p</b> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large":
<h3>Example</h3>
<xmp>
    <p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
</xmp>
<b>Note:</b> A class name cannot start with a number!
<h1>Grouping Selectors</h1>
If you have elements with the same style definitions, like this:
<xmp>
    h1 {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
    }
    
    h2 {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
    }
    
    p {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
    }
</xmp>
It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code. <br><br>
To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma. <br><br>
In the example below we have grouped the selectors from the code above:
<h3>Example</h3>
<xmp>
    h1, h2, p {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
    }
</xmp>
<h1>CSS Comments</h1>
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.<br><br>

Comments are ignored by browsers.<br><br>

A CSS comment starts with /* and ends with */. Comments can also span multiple lines:<br><br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<xmp>p {
    color: red;
    /* This is a single-line comment */
    text-align: center;
}

/* This is
a multi-line
comment */
</xmp>
