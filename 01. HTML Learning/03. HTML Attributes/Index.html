    <h1>HTML Attributes</h1>
    <p>
        Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
        <br><br>
        * HTML elements can have attributes <br>
        * Attributes provide additional information about an element <br>
        * Attributes are always specified in the start tag <br>
        * Attributes come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
    </p> 
    <br>
    <h1>The lang Attribute</h1>
    <xmp>
        The document language can be declared in the <html> tag.

        The language is declared in the lang attribute.

        Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines:
    </xmp>
    <xmp style="border: 1px solid black; width: 500px; margin: 50px;">
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en-US">
        <body>

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>

        </body>
        </html>
    </xmp>
    <p>
        The first two letters specify the language (en). If there is a dialect, use two more letters (US).
    </p>
    <h1>The title Attribute</h1>
    <xmp>
        HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag.

            In this example, the <p> element has a title attribute. The value of the attribute is "About W3Schools":


        Example
            <p title="About W3Schools">
            W3Schools is a web developer's site.
            It provides tutorials and references covering
            many aspects of web programming,
            including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, ASP, etc.
            </p>
    </xmp>
    <h1>The href Attribute</h1>
    <xmp>
        HTML links are defined with the <a> tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:

        Example
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
    </xmp>
    <h1>Size Attributes</h1>
    <xmp>
        HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

        The filename of the source (src), and the size of the image (width and height) are all provided as attributes:

        Example
        <img src="w3schools.jpg" width="104" height="142">

        The image size is specified in pixels: width="104" means 104 screen pixels wide.        
    </xmp>
    <h1>The alt Attribute</h1>
    <xmp>
        The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an HTML element cannot be displayed.

        The value of the attribute can be read by "screen readers". This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, i.e. a blind person, can "hear" the element.

        Example
        <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
    </xmp>
    <h1>HTML Horizontal Rules</h1>
    <xmp>
        The <hr> tag creates a horizontal line in an HTML page.
        The hr element can be used to separate content:

        Example
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </xmp>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <br>
    <xmp>
    The HTML <head> element
        
        The HTML <head> element has nothing to do with HTML headings.

        The HTML <head> element contains meta data. Meta data are not displayed.
                
        The HTML <head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag:


    Example

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    
    <head>
      <title>My First HTML</title>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
    </head>
    
    <body>
    .
    .
    .
    </xmp>
    <br>
    <xmp>
    The HTML <title> Element 

    The HTML <title> element is meta data. It defines the HTML document's title.

    The title will not be displayed in the document, but might be displayed in the browser tab.
    </xmp>
    <br>
    <xmp>
    The HTML <meta> Element

    The HTML <meta> element is also meta data.

    It can be used to define the character set, and other information about the HTML document.


    More Meta Elements

    In the chapter about HTML styles you discover more meta elements:

    The HTML <style> element is used to define internal CSS style sheets.

    The HTML <link> element is used to define external CSS style sheets.
