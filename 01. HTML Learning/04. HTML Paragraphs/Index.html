    <h1>HTML paragraphs</h1>
    <p>HTML documents are divided into paragraphs.</p>
    <br>
    <xmp>The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.</xmp>
    <h1>Example</h1>
    <xmp>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph</p> 
    </xmp>
    <h2>And the browser shows it like this</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph</p>
    <h4> * Browsers automatically add some white space before and after a paragraph.
    </h4>

    <h1>HTML Display</h1>
    <p>
        You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. <br> <br>
        Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results. <br> <br>
        With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code. <br> <br>
        The browser will remove extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed. <br> <br>
        Any number of spaces, and any number of new lines, count as only one space.
    </p>
    <h1>Example</h1>
    <xmp>
        <p>
            This paragraph
            contains a lot of lines
            in the source code,
            but the browser
            ignores it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            This paragraph
            contains         a lot of spaces
            in the source         code,
            but the        browser
            ignores it.
            </p>
    </xmp>

        contains         a lot of spaces

        <h1>HTML Line Breaks</h1>
        <xmp>
        The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
        
        Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
        </xmp>
        <h1>Example</h1>
        <xmp>
            <p>This is<br>a para<br>graph with line breaks</p>
        </xmp>
        <h2>And the browser shows it like this</h2>
        <p>This is<br>a para<br>graph with line breaks</p> <br>
        <xmp>
            The HTML <pre> Element

            The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
            
            The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
        </xmp>
        <h1>Example</h1>
        <xmp>
            <pre>
                My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
              
                My Bonnie lies over the sea.
              
                My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
              
                Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
              </pre>
        </xmp>
        <h2>And the browser shows it like this</h2>
        <pre>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
          
            My Bonnie lies over the sea.
          
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
          
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
          </pre>
