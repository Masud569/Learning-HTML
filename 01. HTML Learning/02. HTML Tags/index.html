    <h1>HTML Tags</h1>
    <xmp>
        HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets:
        <tagname>content</tagname>


        * HTML tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p>
        * The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
        * The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a slash before the tag name
    </xmp>
    <p style="border: 1px solid black; width: 580px;">
        The start tag is often called the opening tag. The end tag is often called the closing tag.
